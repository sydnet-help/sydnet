## Install in 5 Steps

Open [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) and run the following commands to create your new project website with **Project Kickstart-R**:

1. Download [**Project Kickstart-R**](https://github.com/sourcethemes/project-kickstart-r/archive/master.zip) to your working directory:

    ```r
    download.file( url = "https://github.com/sourcethemes/project-kickstart-r/archive/master.zip", destfile="project-kickstart-r.zip")
    ```

2. Extract the ZIP file and open the `project-kickstart-r.Rproj` project:

    ```r
    unzip( zipfile = "project-kickstart-r.zip" )
    ```

3. Install the [Blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) dependencies:

    ```r
    install.packages("blogdown")
    blogdown::install_hugo()
    ```

4. Install the [Academic](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/) framework:

    ```r
    blogdown::install_theme(theme = "gcushen/hugo-academic")
    ```

5. View your new site:

    blogdown::serve_site()
    ```

A browser tab should open, displaying your new website. Otherwise, check your RStudio console messages - you may need to restart RStudio after installing the dependencies.
