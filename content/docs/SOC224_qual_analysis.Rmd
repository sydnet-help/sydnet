# Summary

The main technique we use to analyse words and images is **thematic analysis**. To do this we review our primary data closely, and classify it using **codes**, which is a fancy word for names or tags on highlighted sections of text (or images). When we create the codes as we go, this is called **open coding**. When we use a well organised **codebook**, with definitions and examples, this is called **axial coding**. When we just pull out the most important quotes for use in our final text, this is **selective coding**. **Analytic memos** are notes written by the researcher, for themselves, about the coding process and the patterns they see emerging. **Saturation** - or more accurately, **theoretical saturation** - occurs when reviewing new documents reveals no new themes (i.e. no new codes). At this point we know we can stop data collection and/or data analysis. We generally **write up** qualitative analysis by transforming our most important codes or themes into small **sections of our paper** - normally 3 to 10 themes in length, often each a **subheading** - and for each theme we provide a short explanation, and then an illustrative quote (see **selective coding**). There are a range of more advanced techniques for qualitative analysis, which involve ways of relating your data to your theories (patterns or explanations). **Inductive theorising** involves letting your theory emerge from your data, as you are reviewing it. **Deductive theorising** involves attempting to classify your data into an existing theory, a theory normally found in the existing academic literature. **Analytical comparison** involves comparing cases, with a particular focus on finding the characteristics unique to cases that have a particular outcome. **Narrative or sequence analyses** involve identifying a chain of events or actions or objects that run through a case (or cases). A range of **software** is available for qualitative analysis, including **NVivo**, **Atlas.ti**, and **Dedoose**, but often **scissors and a highlighter**, or **cutting and pasting into a Word document** are the only tools the qualitative research needs to analyse their data.  


# 1. Qualitative data
Qualitative data is words or images which we can't, or don't want to, transform into numbers for mathematical or statistical analysis. Examples of qualitative data include interview transcripts, newspaper articles, paintings, images from the internet, and documents from government or private archives.

In qualitative analysis, as with quantitative analysis, the purpose is to (1) closely look at your primary sources; and (2) search for patterns. 

# 2. Basic tools
## 2.1 Thematic coding
The basic method of analysis for qualitative data is called thematic analysis or thematic coding. This involves classifying different parts of our data into meaningful categories - categories which we call codes or themes.

## 2.2 Coding
### 2.2.1 Open coding
### 2.2.2 Codebook
### 2.2.3 Axial coding
### 2.2.4 Selective coding
Generally we start a coding process by engaging in open coding, where we develop our own codes inductively, as we first examine the texts or images we are analysing. We then develop a codebook, where we formalise the rules of coding, with a definition and examples. We then use this codebook to reanalyse our documents through axial coding - simply meaning we analyse according to the rules of our codebook. After this, we engage in selective coding, which simply means that we choose the most illustrative examples or excerpts for use in our final text.

## 2.3 Analytic memos
As we engage in coding, we often notice patterns or have ideas about the subject we are researching. These ideas are very important, and most qualitative analysts systematically store their patterns and ideas as analytic memos. These analytic memos are notes - on paper, or a word document, or in a specialised program - which are sometimes a short one or two sentence note, and other times many pages in length. These memos can eventually become the basis for your paper or report.

## 2.4 Saturation
One of the problems in qualitative analysis is to know when you have collected and analysed enough data. We say that qualitative analysis of a topic has reached saturation - and therefore a reasonable place to stop - when the analysis (i.e. coding) of new data sources (such as further interview transcripts, or more newspaper articles) reveals no new themes (i.e. no new codes). At saturation, the themes that arise in new data should be ones you have already included in your coding scheme.

## 2.5 Writing up
### 2.5.1 Sections
### 2.5.2 Subheadings
### 2.5.3 3 to 10 themes
When we write up a qualitative analysis, we generally transform our key coding categories or themes into sections of our analysis, often in the form of subheadings. While there are no hard and fast rules, often qualitative analysis with have three to 10 themes organised as subheadings, with each subheading including a brief explanatory text, and then a short quote, excerpt, or example to illustrate that theme/subheading.

# 3 Advanced tools
While thematic analysis and coding are the fundamental tools of qualitative analysis, there are more advanced and complex ways to approach think about your analysis, including: inductive theorising, deductive theorising, analytic comparison, and sequence or narrative analysis.

## 3.1 Inductive theorising
Inductive theorising involves developing your theory (your explanation, your pattern, your coding framework) as you review your primary source documents. The theory emerges from your primary sources. Inductive theorising often starts without a clear conception of the explanation, and sometimes not even a clear conception of the question. However, through the process of data collection and analysis the questions, theories, explanations, and categories emerge, and are slowly refined. Approaches which use this method include successive approximation, and grounded theory.

## 3.2 Deductive theorising
Deductive theorising involves starting with a theory, and then through the review of your primary source documents, finding examples of your theoretical categories (the illustrative method), or comparing and contrasting with a theory (e.g. comparing to an ideal type). The theory comes from somewhere outside of your primary source documents - perhaps from your imagination, or, more commonly, from the existing academic literature.

## 3.3 Analytic comparison
Analytic comparison is a method where cases (whether they be as small as individual interviewees, or as large as nation states or revolutions) are organised and compared. The goal is generally to explain some outcome (such as homelessness of an individual, or revolution in a nation-state) based on characteristics of the cases. Generally we are looking for characteristics which are similar amongst those with the same outcome (the method of agreement), and characteristics which differ across those with different outcomes (the method of difference). One of the ways analytic comparison is implemented in practice is with a truth table - which is very similar to a quantitative data table, with rows being cases, and columns being variables.

## 3.4 Narrative or sequence analysis
Narrative or sequence analysis involves attempting to identify pathways or sequences of events that run through one or more cases. The theory behind the sequence could be deductively derived (i.e. developed before/outside of your empirical data), or inductively derived (i.e. developed through identifying new patterns in your data). Narrative or sequence analysis can be very important when analysing single cases (such as a unique historical event, or an account of a single person or single community)

# 4. Software
There is a large number of software packages developed for qualitative analysis, including NVivo, Atlas.ti, and Dedoose. In many cases, the best and fastest way to do qualitative analysis is using either (1) a photocopier, highlighter, and scissors; or (2) cutting and pasting and note taking in a Microsoft Word document. However, dedicated software, like NVivo, Atlas.ti, and Dedoose, have advantages for larger scale projects, including consistency of codes, collaboration across a large number of researchers, and easy extraction of excerpts across multiple documents.
