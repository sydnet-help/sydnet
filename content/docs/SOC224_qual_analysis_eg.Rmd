# Summary
We review an article which analyses newspaper coverage of eCigarettes. In reviewing this article, we illustrate thematic analysis of qualitative data.

# Preparation
Take a moment to have a look at the article we are using as an example. It is open access. You can access it by simply clicking the link built into the citation below.

[Rooke, C., & Amos, A. (2014). News media representations of electronic cigarettes: an analysis of newspaper coverage in the UK and Scotland. Tobacco Control, 23(6), 507-512. ](https://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/tobaccocontrol/23/6/507.full.pdf?casa_token=jU5ns1LqviYAAAAA:vVuasK7Xicx0TE5Kp-7HuvueShLN9LXAY4ZrsHLExLNyIIkw9qyK3PxxNlMulYZWyqs_SyLnEBOX)

# How to read an article
As a researcher, the way I suggest you read an article is:

1. Read the abstract, focusing on identifying (1) the research question; (2) the dataset; (3) the method of analysis; and (4) the findings
2. Flip to the results, looking at (1) the key subheadings (themes) and (2) any tables or charts.
3. Flip back to the Methods section and clarify the meaning of any of the parts of the abstract or results that don't make sense to you (e.g. "How did they select the sample or data?" or "How did they measure XXX?")

# Research question
The research question for this paper is straight forward: How does the news media represent eCigarettes? 

The topic is important because of (1) their rising popularity; (2) the potential for them to be less harmful that smoking tobacco, and (3) the issues they raise for governments who regulate them.

# The data
The dataset for the paper is 15 newspapers (12 print, 3 online) between 2007 and 2012. 

The authors found these by using the search terms 'electronic cigarette', 'e-cigarette' and 'e cigarette' in an electronic database (Lexis) and also through searching for the terms on the three online newspaper sites. 

They found 119 articles in total.

# The coding process
It is worth reading the last two paragraph of the **Methods** section of this paper closely. I've pasted these two paragraphs below. I've also bolded key words which illustrate key concepts in qualitative analysis

> The **thematic analysis was an iterative process** involving rereading and coding the articles, generating themes and discussing the coding and themes between the authors. As ENDS are an emergent topic, the **initial coding progressed inductively**. Articles were read, reread, and then coded focusing on the following questions: What were ENDS presented as being for? What characteristics of ENDS were emphasised? Who were presented as actual/potential users of ENDS? Where was use of ENDS portrayed/imagined? This initial coding was then organised into key ways of presenting ENDS which recurred throughout the coverage. These were **refined through further coding and discussion to produce five key themes** (box 1). A theme, following Braun and Clarke 'captures something important about the data in relation to the research question, and represents some level of patterned response or meaning within the data set'. **All articles were then coded for the presence of the five themes.** There could be multiple themes in one article, and a theme did not have to be the central focus of the article to be deemed present. An indication of the **prevalence of themes is provided in the Results (table 1)** in order to give a sense of how their presence in articles varied over time. Thirteen articles did not contain any of the five key themes. These articles fell into two main categories: brief reports on surveys sponsored by an ENDS retailer or stories whose main focus was not ENDS.
> 
> CR led the analysis, regularly discussing the development and refining of themes with AA. Articles were then coded for presence of themes by CR. To **check coding reliability**, 19% (23) of the articles selected using a random number generator, were also coded by AA using the definitions in the box. **Cohen's kappa** for the five themes ranged from 0.86 to 1 indicating a good level of agreement for all themes. **Illustrative quotes** from articles are given in the Results with the source, date and page number for newspapers.

### Issues to note
1. When the authors say **"thematic analysis was an iterative process"** and that **"initial coding progressed inductively"** they are stating that they did not start with a pre-existing theory or set of categories which they coded the data. Instead the thematic codes developed. From this we know that they start with **open coding** of the newspaper articles. 
2. When the authors say **"refined through further coding and discussion to produce five key themes"** and **"All articles were then coded for the presence of the five themes"** they are describing how at the end of their **open coding** they developed a **codebook**, and then engaged in **axial coding**. 
3. These authors present some of their results as **quantitative data**, which is described in the methods when they say that **"prevalence of themes is provided in the Results (table 1)."**
4. The authors describe how they checked for **intercoder reliability** and ensured that their coding was **reliable** and **valid** when they describe **"check coding reliability"** and calculating the **"Cohen's kappa"** (which is roughly speaking a form of correlation analysis - testing whether the results of the two coders were similar) 
5. The authors then describe how they engaged in **selective coding** to extract **"Illustrative quotes"** which are used to present the five qualitative themes in the Results section of the paper.

# Step-by-step guide <br/> : But what did they actually do?

## Step 1  <br/> : The data
Their data would have looked like a newspaper article.

Let's pretend they use microsoft word, and in that case they would have pasted all their articles into one or more word documents


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=600,fig.cap="Example of quantitative presentation of themes as a table", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/.png")
```

## Step 2  <br/> : Think 
Before they started coding, they probably would have had a bit of the think about what themes they expected to find. We always have this expectation, even if we don't write it down.

Let's pretend they wrote it down. Perhaps it looked something like Figure 2.


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=600,fig.cap="Themes we expect to find.", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/.png")
```

## Step 3  <br/> : Open coding
They would have then started coding, perhaps it looked something like this


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=600,fig.cap="What there open coding might have looked like", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/.png")
```



## Step 4  <br/> : Debate themes, find argument
They probably had a few different ideas about what they could have eventually chosen as their final coding framework? 

Perhaps their options looked like this. 

Notice how the themes are related to the argument the authors are going to make in the paper.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=600,fig.cap="Different potential options for the final coding framework", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/")
```

## Step 5  <br/> : Codebook
So they then probably developed a simple codebook

Maybe it looked something like this 


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=600,fig.cap="A page of a simple codebook", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/")
```

## Step 6  <br/> : Axial coding
They would have then gone through and done the axial coding, and also they said that 23 of their articles were coded by two researchers (both authors)


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=600,fig.cap="Axial coding", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/")
```



## Step 7  <br/> : Confirm argument & evidence

They probably then looked over what they found and confirmed that what they thought was there was there.

They may at this stage calculate intercoder reliability statistics

## Step 8  <br/> : Selective coding & write-up
They would have then gone and extracted their illustrative quotes (selective coding), and written them up. It ended up looking like the paragraph below in Figure XXX


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=400,fig.cap="Writing up a theme with illustrative quotes and explanation.", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/soc224_qual_analysis_eg_subheading_illustrative_quotes.png")
```



## Step 9  <br/> : Tabulation

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=600,fig.cap="Example of quantitative presentation of themes as a table", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/soc224_qual_analysis_eg_table_1.png")
```
