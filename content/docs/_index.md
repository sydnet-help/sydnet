Methods101.com provides easy to follow lessons on social research methods.

The site focuses on teaching you how to analyse quantitative data with the statistical packages R and SPSS.

However, we also cover a range of other topics, including:

* an introduction to statistics,
* advice on academic writing, and
* guides to qualitative analysis with software like NVivo and Dedoose.

Below are the units available on this site: (this is a temporary solution until I can work out how to collapse the sidebar menu)
