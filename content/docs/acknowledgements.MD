This website would not have been possible without the funding provided by the Macquarie University PVC Teaching and Learning Office and facilitated by Professor Garry Falloon. Brian Ballsun-Stanton was of great assistance in setting this project on track with advice and guidance. 

The materials on this website have been contributed by Nicholas Harrigan, Hang-Young Lee, Ben Spiers-Butcher, and Tobia Fattore.

The website was developed using the Hugo Academic theme and modified by Ryan King and Nicholas Harrigan.

This website makes significant use of R code and so would not have been possible without the work of all those who contributed to the non-profit [R-Project](https://www.r-project.org/).
