<p>Summary: The main method of analysing qualitative data – data like interviews, video footage, letters, etc. – is to code the data into thematic categories. I am going to assume for sake of convenience that in your case you are coding up qualitative interviews, but a similar method would be used for most qualitative data sources.</p>
<div id="step-1---read-a-sample-of-your-data-and-come-up-with-a-preliminary-argumentabstract-for-your-paper" class="section level2">
<h2>STEP 1 - Read a sample of your data and come up with a preliminary argument/abstract for your paper</h2>
<p>Your data at this stage is in the form of either complete transcripts, or a typed up version of your notes. Either way, they should be in a Word document.</p>
<p>If you have a small number of transcripts, then you can read all the transcripts/notes at this stage.</p>
<p>If you have a large number, then you should read a sample – maybe 10 to 20 – to get a feel for the data. Underline relevant sections. Attempt to identify themes. Attempt to identify quotes that could be evidence for a larger argument of the whole paper.</p>
</div>
<div id="step-2-come-up-with-5-15-headingstopics-which-you-will-organise-your-reporting-of-your-primary-data-under" class="section level2">
<h2>STEP 2: Come up with 5-15 headings/topics which you will organise your reporting of your primary data under</h2>
<p>At this stage you want to come up with (1) your overall argument for your paper, and (2) the headings which you will organise your evidence under.</p>
<p>In terms of formulating your argument/abstract, I have dealt with this is other documents. The main thing to note is that you should remember to use Belchers Pre-Fab Thesis generator. It almost never fails.</p>
<p>Once you have your argument, look back over the sample of 10-20 interviews you read and try to work out how you can organise the quotes that are relevant under about 5 to 15 headings. Note that the headings can be nested.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of headings used in qualitative articles</p>

<div id="step-3-go-through-your-primary-data-item-by-item-and-cut-and-paste-quotes-from-the-primary-data-sources-under-relevant-headings" class="section level2">
<h2>STEP 3: Go through your primary data item by item, and cut and paste quotes from the primary data sources under relevant headings</h2>
<p>This can take quite a while. It is the main boring repetitive work of qualitative data analysis. But you need to keep your brain switched on, because you need to be constantly thinking about the material you are reading and deciding “Will this make good evidence?” and “What argument or theory does this support or oppose?”</p>
<p>A couple of tips:
• Remember the same quote/passage might need to be cut and paste under multiple headings.
• You will need to keep track of where the quotes came from. The easiest way to do this is to put a little reference at the end of each quote, e.g. [Interview 15], or [Vik #08, male, 29]</p>
<p>There are specialized computer packages for this coding stage. The main ones are NVivo, and ATLAS.ti. While they can make coding easier, in all honesty you can get work done with about 80-90% of the efficiency by just using two Word documents open next to each other. One of the word documents will be the transcript you are analysing, and one will be the document into which you are placing quotes, under headings.</p>

<div id="step-4-go-through-the-material-under-each-heading-and-reduce-the-material-under-each-heading-to-about-200-500-words-of-summary-analysis-and-exemplary-quotes." class="section level2">
<h2>STEP 4: Go through the material under each heading and reduce the material under each heading to about 200-500 words of summary, analysis, and exemplary quotes.</h2>
<p>Step 3 will most likely NOT have reduced the amount of text you have – because many quotes will be relevant to multiple headings – but it will have organised it in a much more manageable fashion.</p>
<p>This next step transforms your huge mass of text into manageable paragraphs and quotes.</p>
<p>Your job in this section ISN’T just to paste together the best quotes. Your job is to present your evidence (the quotes, or summaries of the quotes) in the context of your argument (and also in the context of arguments you are trying to disprove).</p>
<p>This series of headings becomes your “Results”.</p>
<p>Example 1.3 shows how the article on substance use during pregnancy presents their evidence under the heading “Practice Style”. Note that there are six other headings like this in the results section of the paper.</p>
<p>Example 1.4 shows a useful method for summarizing qualitative results. It is a table containing the main findings of a study.
