Summary: The first thing you generally want to do with a quantitative data set is to run a bi-variate correlation, almost always a Pearson’s correlation. The correlations you are particularly interested in are the correlations between the dependent variable(s) and the main independent variables.

1)  Go to Analyze > Correlate > Bivariate

{{< figure library="1" src="htad_lesson_03_image_01.png" >}}

The left window contains all the variables in your dataset NOT in the correlation. The right window contains all the variables in the correlation.

2)  For this analysis, you want everything in the analysis. So click on one of the variables in the left window and then press “Control + A”. This will ‘select all’.

3)  Then click the arrow in the middle of the screen. This will move all the variables to the right.

4)  The default options are fine, so then just click ‘OK’

5)  You should see a huge, almost unreadable, table like the one below. This version can be useful for identifying correlations between your independent variables.

6)  Double click anywhere on the table, and “Pivot Table” should appear
7)  If the “Pivot Trays” are not showing go to Pivot>Pivot Trays

{{< figure library="1" src="htad_lesson_03_image_05.png" >}}
 
8)  The Pivot Trays should appear as below.

9)  Click and hold the vertically written word “Variables”, and drag it to the top white box on the “LAYER”

{{< figure library="1" src="htad_lesson_03_image_07.png" >}}
 
10) On the Pivot Table, you will see a drop down box. Click on this and select your dependent variable. You will now have a list of the bivariate correlations of all your independent variables with your dependent variable.
