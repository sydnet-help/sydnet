# Summary
Before you analyse a quantitative dataset you need to 

* Step 1: download the data (generally from Qualtrics), 
* Step 2: make a codebook,  
* Step 3: clean up your data, and then
* Step 4: import your data into SPSS.

# Step 1 - How to download your data from Qualtrics 

1) Go to https://mqedu.qualtrics.com/

2) Type in your User ID and Password

3) Click the Sign In button

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=400, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/htad_lesson_02_image_01.png")
```

4) After Signing In, scroll down 

5) Click on the name of the survey you want to work on

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=400, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/htad_lesson_02_image_02.png")
```

6)  Click the "Data & Analysis"" tab

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=600, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/htad_lesson_02_image_03.png")
```

7)  Click the "Export & Import" icon, and then select "Export Data"
 
 ```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=600, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/htad_lesson_02_image_04.png")
```

8) A dialogue box will open and you will need to make some choices. 

My recommendation is to choose:

* "Use numeric values" 
* Download as CSV file
* UNSELECT "Compress data as .zip file"
* SELECT "Recode seen but unanswered questions as -99" 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=400, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/htad_lesson_02_image_05.png")
```

9) Click the Download button

10) Save dataset on your computer with some relevant name such as "Survey Data.csv"

# Step 2 - Creating a codebook

A codebook tells you what the numbers in your dataset actually mean. 

For example, if you have a "1" in the Gender variable, does it mean Male? Female? Other? or something else? 
In professional studies, elaborate codebooks are created. 

However, for your data, you just need something to double check the meaning of the numbers in your dataset. 
So I'm going to teach you a simple method to create a basic codebook.

1) On Qualtrics, go to the "Survey" tab, and then select the "Tools" button, and then "Import/Export" and "Export Survey to Word"

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=600, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/htad_lesson_02_image_06.png")
```

2) A dialogue box will open up.

I recommend using the default options, except:

* SELECT "Show Survey Flow"

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=400, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/htad_lesson_02_image_07.png")
```
 
3)  Click 'Export' and save our file with a sensible name like "Survey Codebook.docx"

If you open this Word document, you will see how next to each choice for a survey there is a number. For example, in the image below, you can see that "Under 18" is coded as "1".

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=600, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/htad_lesson_02_image_08.png")
```

# Step 3 - Cleaning your data

1)  Before you import your data into SPSS, you are probably going to want to clean it up.

The first step is to open it in Excel. 

You are looking for open ended questions which respondants are likely to have put data that SPSS can't analyse. 

You can see in the image below, the question asks "What is your base hourly wage?" and it provided a text box for people to type in. 

However, the data people have left is messy. Some put dollar signes, most didn't. Some put ranges. Some put "Not sure"

You will need to clean this up. The way you want to do this is by having some clear rules, and writing them down in your codebook. 

For this, I would suggest the following rules;

* remove all dollar signs
* replace ranges with the mean of the two numbers given (e.g. if they say 5-10, then change to 7.5)
* replace "Not sure" and similar with missing -99

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=200, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/htad_lesson_02_image_09.png")
```

2) After you have cleaned up your data, save it as an excel file (.xlsx). This is needed for importing into SPSS. 

# Step 4 - Importing into SPSS

1) To get your datafile into iLab, you will need to put your excel file on a USB drive. 

2)  Go into iLab, and then open SPSS (see Lab 1).

3)  Close the first dialogue box that opens

4)  Go to File > Open > Data 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=600, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/htad_lesson_02_image_10.png")
```

4)  In the dialogue box that opens, change Files of type to Excel.

5)  Navigate to select your dataset.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=600, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/htad_lesson_02_image_11.png")
```
