**4pm - 6pm Mondays:** Drop in consulations (weeks 1 to 14, not including break weeks; room TBC, but probably the same room as class, or a room near by)

**6pm - 9pm Mondays:** Class

* **Part 1: Lecture** (45 - 60 min) - powerpoint slides to be provided at beginning of class 
* **Part 2: Demonstration in R** (45 - 60 min) - R script to be provided at beginning of class
* **Part 3: Student exercises** (45 - 60 min) - PDF/Word outline of exercise to be provided at beginning of class

# Structure of assessment

# What you can expect of me

1. Before semester starts:
	* provide weekly topics, weekly readings, and key concepts to identify in your reading
1. Outside class
1. Before class
1. In class, each week:
	1. By 6pm Monday (the beginning of class) I will upload to methods101, and iLearn:
		1. powerpoint slides for that week's lecture
		1. R-script for that week's demonstration
		1. a PDF or Word Doc with the student exercises for that week
	1. Present a 30 to 60 minute lecture on the topic for that week
	1. Present a 30 to 60 minute demonstration of the concepts for that week, in the form of an analysis in R (we will review an RScript, and look at the output)
	1. Facilitate a 30 to 60 minute student exercise - where you will be given a dataset and series of tasks to accomplish. You will do this individually, so you all develop the skills and get the practice needed, but I will be present to help with problems and answer questions.

# What I can expect of you

* Before the first class:

* Each week, before class:

* Each week, in class:

* Read required readings before class, and note any questions you have
* Install R and RStudio on your laptop before week 1's class
* Bring your laptop to class
* Participate in class through asking questions, demonstrating that you have done readings, listening and appropriately responding to comments and questions from me and other students, undertaking in-class exercises, and doing so in a way that is respectful of other participants in class.
* By week 4
* In each of week 7 and week 13 present a replication of an academic paper, based on a publicly available dataset. Assessed work will consist of:
	* a 15 minute presentation with powerpoint slides
	* a report which contains a selection of up to five tables and figures (no more than five), and approximately 2-3 pages of text (~600-1000 words) explaining the meaning of these tables and figures. While the exact tables will differ, depending on the paper being replicated, these should normally include:
		* a univariate statistics table (mean, SD, min, max, n, etc.)
		* a bivariate statistics table (correlation matrix or similar)
		* a set of nested regression models
		* a figure to graphically illustrate the impact of the independent variable/s on the dependent variable.
	* a copy of the dataset (in R data format, or csv, or spss, or excel or similar data file)
	* a copy of your annotated (i.e. with comments) R code (script file)
