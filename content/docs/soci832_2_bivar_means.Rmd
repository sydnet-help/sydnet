# Stuff you need to do before starting

### 1) Change this to your working directory

```{r eval=FALSE}
setwd("C:/G/2018, SOCI832/Datasets/AES 2013/") 
```

### 2) Put the file "elect_2013.csv" into that folder This file can be found here:
<https://mqsociology.github.io/learn-r/soci832/elect_2013.csv> 

### 3) Keep the codebook openned in a browser so you can refer to it when you need it. The codebook is here:
<https://mqsociology.github.io/learn-r/soci832/codebook%20aes%202013.html> 

### 4) Install summarytools package if you havne't already

```{r}
install.packages("summarytools", 
                 repos = 'http://cran.rstudio.com')  # install the package (once, and then # it out)
library(summarytools) # load the library
``` 

### 5) Import the data

```{r}
elect_2013 <- read.csv("elect_2013.csv")  # loads dataset 
```

### 6) The next command (below) gets rid of the first column which is not needed. 
FYI the command works by saying  "copy all columns except the first". NOTE: Only run this command once after you run the 'read.csv' command. Each time you run it, it deletes the first variable. 

```{r}
    elect_2013 <- elect_2013[,2:ncol(elect_2013)]
```

# 1. Crosstabs 

This section shows how to cross- tabulate the levels of two variables. This is often one of the simplest ways to get a quick look at the relationship between two variables

## Crosstabs Example 1: Pol Know vs Likelihood voting 

This is how the command 'ctable()' presents a cross tabulation with default settings:

```{r}
print(ctable(elect_2013$pol_knowledge, 
     elect_2013$likelihood_vote), 
     method = 'rmarkdown')
```

Notice that each cell in the table has two numbers the first number is the number of survey respondents who had those two values of the two variables.  For exampke, there are 51 people who got zero on the political knowledge quiz, and who also said their likelihood of voting if voting was not compulsory was 'definitely not' (i.e. a 1 on a 5 point scale). The second number in each cell (contained in brakets)  is a percentage. In this default setting, this is the row percentage - the percentage of people with a political knowledge score of zero, who have a '1' on the 'likelihood_vote' variable. You can see that this is 12.44%. 

Often when reading cross tabulations it can be difficult to work out whether the percentages are row or column percentages. One of the easiest ways to work this out is to simply look at the Total column, and Total row. Almost always you will find that one of the two Totals is equalt to 100% for all values of a variable. The total with the 100% is the denominator for all cells in it's row or column. 

So in this case, we can see that the Total column has 100% for all variables, telling you that the percentages are "percent of people with political knowledge of X, who had a likelihood of voting of Y." 'prop' ARGUMENT We can control the displaying of row and column percentages with the argument 'prop'. prop takes four different settings "r" for 'row percentages is the default (so you don't need to put this setting in). The other options are: "c" for column totals (cell count/column count) "t" for displaying percent of all cases (cell count/total count) "n" for none - no percentages

So this command displays column totals

```{r}
print(ctable(elect_2013$pol_knowledge, 
      elect_2013$likelihood_vote, 
      prop = "c"),
      method = 'rmarkdown', footnote = NA)
```

Percentages of the total number of participants/cases

```{r}
    print(ctable(elect_2013$pol_knowledge, 
          elect_2013$likelihood_vote, 
          prop = "t"),
          method = 'rmarkdown', footnote = NA)
```

No percentages

```{r}
    print(ctable(elect_2013$pol_knowledge, 
          elect_2013$likelihood_vote, 
          prop = "n"),
          method = 'rmarkdown', footnote = NA)
```

As with the other summarytools functions, you can use various arguments to clean up the display of your table. Note that for some reason we use the argument 'useNA' rather than 'report.nas' to remove NAs from our table.

````{r}
    print(ctable(elect_2013$pol_knowledge, 
          elect_2013$likelihood_vote, 
          omit.headings = TRUE, 
          totals = FALSE, 
          useNA = "no",
          prop = "n"),
          method = 'rmarkdown', footnote = NA)
```

# 2. Comparison of means

We will learn about the basic ways to compare the difference in means of two groups - one where the groups are independent (e.g. height of men and women), and one where they are paired (e.g. height of the same people at age 15 and age 15.5 years).

### Example 1

Let's say we want to compare the political knowledge of men and women in our dataset. We want to ask if the mean for men, and the mean for women is different the command to test this is 't.test'.

```{r}
    t.test(elect_2013$pol_knowledge ~ elect_2013$female)
```

In the console window you should see:

```{r}
# Welch Two Sample t-test  data:  elect_2013$pol_knowledge by elect_2013$female t = 11.64, df = 3838.6, p-value < 2.2e-16 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: 0.8891745 1.2493867 
#     sample estimates: 
#     mean in group 0 mean in group 1
#           5.328302        4.259021 
#     >
```

Now I know this looks like a mess, but it is actually not too difficult to understand. The fundamental rule I teach is that the first thing you do when you run a test is look at the p-value, and see if it is below 0.05. If it is not below 0.05, then there is generally not a need to interpret anything else because the test is not significant. [There is a complication to this instruction, because some statistical commands give multiple p-values - one for each variable, and one for the model overall - but we will deal with that later] So if we follow this rule of looking at the p-value first, What does it say? 

The p-value in this case is "p-value < 2.2e-16". What does that mean? it means the number 2.2 with 16 zeros in FRONT of it. i.e. p = 0.000000000000000022. Is that less than 0.05? Yes!

So what is the next step for intepreting this output? 

Let's look at the last three line. They say:

```{r}    
# sample estimates: 
# mean in group 0 mean in group 1
#       5.328302        4.259021 
```
      
This is telling us that the mean of the group with value "0" is 5.33, and the mean for the group with value "1" is 4.26. But what is group 0 and 1? Well we need to look at our data. The means are measure in "pol_knowledge" units, and the variable for gender is 1 = female, and 0 = male. so this tells us that the mean political knowledge for men in our sample is 5.3, and for women is 4.3.

We could stop interpreting our data here, but there is another useful part of the output to interpret. Look at these two lines:

```{r}
#    95 percent confidence interval: 0.8891745 1.2493867
```

This tells us that the 'difference of means' between men and women has a 95% confidence interval of 0.89 to 1.25. This says that the TRUE difference between men and women - the population parameter - is with 95% certainty between 0.89 and 1.25. 

The second type of comparison of means we are going to run is the paired test. In a paired test the two variables to be measured are measured on the same units of analysis The reason we need a different test for this is because when the same unit of analysis is used for the two variables the two variables are dependent on each other - they are not independent samples - as so the statistical test changes to account for this.

###  Example 2

In the next example, we are going to compare participants average score for 'following the election on TV' vs 'following the election in the newspaper'.

```{r}
t.test(elect_2013$election_tv, 
   elect_2013$election_newspaper, 
   paired = TRUE)
```

This can be read in the same way as the previous t-test except that in this case the last line reports the difference in means, not the two means. 

Intuitively we know that this means people followed the election more in the newspaper than on TV, but we can check this, by just running two means() to double check we are right:

```{r}
mean(elect_2013$election_tv, na.rm = TRUE)
```
```{r}
mean(elect_2013$election_newspaper, na.rm = TRUE)
```

And you can see that what we thought was true is, with people having an average score of 2.01 for election_tv, and 2.43 for election_newspaper.

# 3. Correlation

Coorelation coefficents are some of the most widely used and reported statistics in academic papers. In this section we learn about how to obtain the most common types of correlation coefficients. We also create our own function for making very attractive correlation matricies.

We will be needing these two packages later, so make sure you have installed them, and also loaded them into this session of by calling them using the 'library' command.

```{r}
install.packages("Hmisc", repos = 'http://cran.rstudio.com') 
# hash this out after installing on your computer
install.packages("xtable", repos = 'http://cran.rstudio.com') 
# and this.
library(xtable)
library(Hmisc)
```
    
The third form of bivariate statistics we are learning about today is correlation, and in particular correlation coefficients. 

Correlation coefficients can roughly be defined as: 

* a measure of the relationship between two variables 
* that is standardised so that 
** a perfect positive correlation is 1 
** a perfect negative correlation is -1 
** and no relationship is 0

It turns out that there are lots of different correlation coefficients, and statisticians are probably still inventing new correlation coefficients today.

When most people talk about correlation coefficients, or just correlation, they are talking about the most famous and widely used correlation coefficient called "Pearson correlation coefficient". This was invented by the famous statistician Karl Pearson. It is also called 'Pearson's R' and sometimes just 'r'. And that has no relationships with the statistical package 'R'! Each correlation coefficient is measured in a different way, and this is so that it takes account of the different types of data that the coefficient is working with.

When we have approximately continuous data, Pearson's correlation coefficient is the best measure, and by learning about this measure, you will get a sense of what all the different correlation coefficients are trying to do.

There is an excellent four page explaination of Pearson's r in Field et al. 2012 pages 206-209 (6.3.1- 6.3.2) which recommend everyone read. I will try to summarise it here, but my explanation will be overly simple.

A correlation coefficient brings together two main ideas: (1) covariance; and (2) standardisation. 

Covariance is the idea that for two variables, when one is high on an individual, the other variable will also be high, and vice versa - when one is low, the other variable will be low. 

We could think of a very simple example of measuring height and weight on everyone in a school. Now we know that height and weight are not perfectly correlated because there are lots of other factors. But we also know that they tend to move together. This "moving together" is covariance.

The way statisticians measure covariance is by looking at how much two measures move away from the mean of the whole sample. So if we have a school where the average height is 130cm and the average weight is 50kg, statisticians would measure the covariance by asking "When someone differs from the mean height, do they also differ by a similar amount in the same direction from the mean weight?"

Mathematically the covariances of a person called Anne is: (Anne's weight - average school weight)* (Anne's height - average school height)

For the whole school, we can calcuate the average covariance which is called covariance by taking the average (actually n-1 is the denominator - which I won't explain) And this will give us a number that is positive if height and weight move together, and negative if they don't, and approximately zero if there is no relationship.

However, we have a problem, which is that the units of covariance dependent on what we are measuring and the units we are measuring it.

Statisticians solve this by using 'standardisation', which is actually used in many different settings. 

The formula for standardisation (in almost all settings) is "subtract the mean from each case, and then divide by the standard deviation". The reason you subtract the mean from each case, is that it causes the new mean of all cases to be zero.

Now it turns out that for covariance, we have already subtracted the mean as part of the formula, so we don't need to worry about this.

The second rule is to divide by the standard deviation of a variable (or in this case, the product of the standard deviation of each variable). Why? Because It transforms ALL our units of analysis - that is EVERY variable we divide by it's own standard deviation - so that the numbers "1" and "-1" mean exactly the same thing: they mean 1 standard deviation from the mean of the variable in the sample.

This can be seen in Field et al. 2012 in equation 6.3. 

And the result is a magical number called Pearon's r.

When a statistical packages such as R calculates a Pearons's r for you, there two questions you should be asking about the number: 

* Is it 'significant'? - which we measure with p-value and/or confidence intervals. 
* Is it 'important'? - which we call the effect size.

Reading significance with p-values is pretty straight forward. Remember that we ask is the p-value < 0.05

Reading confidence intervals is similarly easy. Generally we say that a Pearson's r is significant if the 95% confidence interval does not include zero (because if it did include zero, then there is a greater than 5% chance that the true parameter is zero). But how do we know 'importance'? 

There is a concept in statistics which has grown in importance over the last 30 years, and this is known as 'effect size'. The argument goes something like this: If you have a large enough sample size, then you can get a p-value less than 0.05 for something that is actually of only trivial importance. And for this reason, we can't just use p-values to tell us whether something really matters in the real world.

As a result of this criticism, the notion of effect size's has developed. 

A variable has a large effect on another variable if, for example, a one standard deviation variation in one variable causes (or is correlated with) a one standard deviation variation in the second variable.

We can see here that we are thinking about how variance, measured in standardised units, in one variable is related to variance in another. 

Anyway, we will be returning to effect size quite a few times in this course, for the moment, I just want you to know that in the case of Pearson's r, effect size is measured DIRECTLY in the coefficient. And the rule of thumb for interpreting effect sizes of a Pearson's r are:

* small effect size: +/- 0.1 - 0.2
* medium effect size: +/- 0.3 - 0.4
* large effect size: +/- 0.5+

Now, while 'small', 'medium', and 'large' are quite vague terms, they are honestly used in much of statistics

One way to get a grip on what these mean is to take the square of pearson's r, which is called 'R-square' or 'R-squared'. 

It turns out that R-squared can be read directly as the "Proportion of variation in one variable explained by the second and vice versa". 

In short, it can basically be read like a proportion (or if you like, percentage, just multiple by 100).

So if we transform these Pearson's r into R-square, we can rewrite the rule of thumb for effect size measured in R-square as: 

* small effect size: 0.01-0.04 (i.e 1%-4%) 
* medium effect size: 0.09-0.16 (i.e.9%-16%) 
* large effect size: 0.25+ (ie. 25%+)

With these rules of thumb in hand, let's look at our data and analysis it with R.

## Correlation Method 1: cor.test()

The two simplest commands to get a correlation coefficient are cor() and cor.test()

cor() unfortuately doesn't give a lot of information so it's not that useful. cor.test() however is quite useful.

Let's look at the correlation between five different variables and likelihood of voting. I'm going to move from those with little or no effect size, through to those with a large effect size.

This first correlation shows the relationship between urban/rural location and likelihood of voting

```{r}
cor.test(elect_2013$rural_urban, 
         elect_2013$likelihood_vote)
```

You should see something like the following in your console window:

```{r}          
# Pearson's product-moment correlation  
# data:  elect_2013$rural_urban and elect_2013$likelihood_vote 
# t = 1.3682, df = 3801, p-value = 0.1713 
# alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0 
# 95 percent confidence interval:  
# -0.009604256  0.053932694 
# sample estimates: 
# cor
# 0.02218662 
```
 
How do we read this? 

Remember the first thing to do is to look at the p-value. In this case it is 0.17, which is greater that 0.05, so we can safely say the correlation coefficient is not significantly different from zero.

We can also see this when we look at the 95% confidence interval, which is from -0.0096 to 0.053. Notice that the 95% confidence interval includes zero, which means that we can't be confident the true parameter is not zero.

We can also see that the correlation coefficient is 0.022 - which is tiny. Remember that a correlation of 0.1 is considered a small effect size, and this is one fifth of that. 

Let's next look at the effect of highest educational qualification:

```{r}
cor.test(elect_2013$highest_qual,
        elect_2013$likelihood_vote)
```

in this case, the p-value is below 0.05, so the correlation is significant, but when you look at the correlation coefficient - it is basically 0.04, which again is tiny. So this is a case of 'significant' but 'not very meaningful'.

Next let's look at the impact of internet skills on the likelihood of voting:

```{r}
cor.test(elect_2013$internet_skills, elect_2013$likelihood_vote)
```

In this case, the correlation is highly significant and the effect size - basically 0.09 - is small but meaningful. So those people who have better internet skills tend to be more likely to vote.

Next let's look at something with a much larger effect size: political knowledge. 

```{r}
cor.test(elect_2013$pol_knowledge, elect_2013$likelihood_vote)
```

In this case the p-value is incredibly small, and the correlation coefficient is 0.37 - a medium sized effect. 

Last, let's look at the impact of interest in politics:

```{r}
cor.test(elect_2013$interest_pol, elect_2013$likelihood_vote)
```

In this case the relationship is highly significant and effect size is large, but the relationship is negative: -0.52.

Does this mean that people who are interested in politics are less likely to vote? Are those interested in politics all anarchists? 

What do you think?

When you get a result like this, you should check two things: your codebook, and your data-entry/data cleaning.

If you look at the codebook, then you will find that "interest_pol" is reverse coded. 
   (1) = A good deal of interest in politics, while 
   (4) = None (no interest in politics). 

Thus, the real meaning of this correlation is that those who are more interested in politics are much more likely to say they will vote. 

In fact, we can say that approximately 25% of the variance in likelihood of voting is explained by variance in interest in politics (by calculating the R-square).

## Correlation Method 2: corstar()

AN EASY WAY TO MAKE A CORRELATION MATRIX

The command I have taught you above - cor.test() - is fine for testing the relationship between just two variables. However, often you want to be able to look at the correlations between a large set of variables all the at the one time.

Actually many journal articles expect you to produce a correlation matrix of all your variables as a prelude to then running a linear regression model. 

I have found a function on the internet which will allow you to easily make your own correlation matrix. 

The function is called 'corstar()'. 

**NOTE: To use it, you first need to run the code below and create the function in the memory of your computer.**

You don't need to understand the code, but do feel free to take a look.

When you are ready run the code from where I type #START HERE# to #END HERE#

### #START HERE# 
```{r}
corstars <-function(x, method=c("pearson", "spearman"),
                    removeTriangle=c("upper", "lower"),
                    result=c("none", "html", "latex")){

# * https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2008-March/156583.html

#Compute correlation matrix
    require(Hmisc)
    x <- as.matrix(x)
    correlation_matrix<-rcorr(x, type=method[1])
    R <- correlation_matrix$r 
      # Matrix of correlation coeficients
    p <- correlation_matrix$P 
      # Matrix of p-value

## Define notions for significance levels; spacing is important.
    mystars <- ifelse(p < .0001, "****", 
                  ifelse(p < .001, "*** ", 
                    ifelse(p < .01, "** ", 
                      ifelse(p < .05, "*  ", "    "))))

## trunctuate the correlation matrix to two decimal
    R <- format(round(cbind(rep(-1.11, 
                                ncol(x)), R), 2))[,-1]

## build a new matrix that includes the correlations with their apropriate stars
    Rnew <- matrix(paste(R, mystars, sep=""), ncol=ncol(x))
    diag(Rnew) <- paste(diag(R), " ", sep="")
    rownames(Rnew) <- colnames(x)
    colnames(Rnew) <- paste(colnames(x), "", sep="")

## remove upper triangle of correlation matrix
    if(removeTriangle[1]=="upper"){
      Rnew <- as.matrix(Rnew)
      Rnew[upper.tri(Rnew, diag = TRUE)] <- ""
      Rnew <- as.data.frame(Rnew)
    }

## remove lower triangle of correlation matrix
    else if(removeTriangle[1]=="lower"){
      Rnew <- as.matrix(Rnew)
      Rnew[lower.tri(Rnew, diag = TRUE)] <- ""
      Rnew <- as.data.frame(Rnew)
    }

    ## remove last column and return the correlation matrix
    Rnew <- cbind(Rnew[1:length(Rnew)-1])
    if (result[1]=="none") return(Rnew)
    else{
      if(result[1]=="html") print(xtable(Rnew), type="html")
      else print(xtable(Rnew), type="latex")
    }
  }
```
### #END HERE#

If you have run that code, then the code should have appeared in your console window, but nothing else should have happened.

You have loaded 'corstars()' into your computer you can now run the corstars command and generate a correlation matrix.

I have created the code below to allow you to run, save, and view the output of corstars(). 

The three lines of code below will: 

1. create a correlation table and save it in variable x 
2. save this to your computer as a file 
3. open that file in a browser, so you can see the table. 

Feel free to run the following code:

```{r eval=FALSE}
    x <- print(xtable(corstars(elect_2013)), type="html")
    dput(x, file = "output.html")
    browseURL("output.html")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
    print(xtable(corstars(elect_2013)), type="html")
```

The correlation matrix should open in your browser. Significance is indicated with stars:

* **** = p < .0001
*  *** = p < .001
*   ** = p < .01
*    * = p < .05

**This is the end of the Bivariate statistics R code/ R-script file. The class continues in the code "Week 2, Part 3, Linear Regression.R'**
